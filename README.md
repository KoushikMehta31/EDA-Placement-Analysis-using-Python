# 📌 Project Title: EDA Placement Analysis using Python

---

## 📝 Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of engineering students' journey from admission to placement.  
It aims to uncover key insights and trends that influence placement outcomes based on:

- 🎓 Branch
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Gender
- 💼 Internship Experience
- 📊 CGPA
- ⚠️ Backlogs

Using **Python** and visualization libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas**, this analysis identifies:

- Factors that positively or negatively impact placements  
- Trends in placement across departments and demographics  
- The relationship between academic performance, internships, and placement success

## 📊 Key Analysis Insights

### 1. 📈 Placement Distribution
- Pie chart shows percentage of students **placed vs. not placed**
- Majority are placed, but a significant portion remains unplaced

### 2. 🎓 Gender-Based Placement
- Males have a **slightly higher** placement rate than females
- Visualized using bar plots and count plots

### 3. 🧑‍💻 Internship Impact
- Students with **internship experience** are **more likely to get placed**
- Shown using comparative bar graphs

### 4. 🎯 CGPA vs. Placement
- Higher **CGPA** increases placement chances
- **Violin and box plots** demonstrate CGPA spread for placed vs. unplaced students

### 5. ⚠️ Backlogs vs. Placement
- Students with **no backlogs** have **much higher** placement rates
- Backlogs negatively affect placement probability

### 6. 🏢 Branch-Wise Placement
- **CSE** and **IT** branches have **highest placement ratios**
- **Mechanical** and **Civil** branches lag behind in placement count
